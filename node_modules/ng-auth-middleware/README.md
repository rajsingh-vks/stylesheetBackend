## Docs

Some initial docs are [here](https://github.com/A20Group/ngAuthMiddleware/wiki).

### First step:

Inject `ngAuthMiddleware` in app module.

```javascript
var app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngAuthMiddleware"]);
```

### Second step:

Inject `$authProvider` in config file, as mentioned above the object exist in `authProviderConfigure()` has some properties which want explain here:

#### create object of authProvider.

```javascript
authProvider.configure({
  withPermission: false,

  rolePropertyName: "userRole",

  roles: [
    {
      action: "state",

      roleName: "defult",

      afterSignIn: "app.dashboard",

      afterLogOut: "app.login"
    }
  ]
});
```

#### "with permission":

Could set false or true, if set false you haven't connection with angular-permission else you have connected with angular-permission, if you dont set value by default set false.

#### "permissionPropertyName":

The response you receive from the server in which property the permissions are assigned. if 'withPermission' is true, it will be requirement.

#### "rolePropertyName":

The response you receive from the server in which property the roles are assigned.

#### "roles":

This property is array which set objects,each object says how to behave with each role:

##### "roles > action":

Could set href or state, href uses for change url in one project externally, state uses for change url in one project internally.

##### "roles > roleName":

Could set name of role and you can set just one role, if your project has multiRole, you have to set multiRole for value of roleName and go to selected role page to choose one role, and at the end you have to set default for one of objects which exist in roles array.

##### "afterSignIn":

As is clear from the word, which page to go after login.

##### "afterLogOut":

As is clear from the word, which page to go after logOut.
